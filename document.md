# Usage:

* To compile use `make` in the root directory

* First, run the bank application, and then use the client application to connect 

# General information:
* In the "src" directory there are the main .c files
* In the "db" directory there is a .txt file used as a "database"

# Actions
* Firstly, I thought about the basic architecture of the applications and how they should communicate with each other
* Secondly, writing the code and trying to figure out how everything works *(basically experimenting)* 
* Thirdly, a lot, and I mean a lot, of debugging and frustration from desynchronization

# Challenges
* General C things like pretty obvious segfaults
* Figuring out how to connect everything *(IPC)*
